Description = VERSION 6.6.0.0 (2019-05-29)
Description1 = Added in the ability to set a launch delay. Added default window retitle to use alias, and fall back to account name if an alias is not set.
Feature = With a launch delay, a custom user preference file should work again. Also, plugins are a lot happier if you give their DLL time to relax between launches.
Enhancement = You can now see your alias in the window title! Huzzah. Thanks for the suggestion Dirty Elf.
BugFix = Thanks to trevis, the launcher should also detect dead clients better than before!
